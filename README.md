TrackMySleepQuality - Starter Code for 6.2 Coroutines codelab
=============================================================

Starter code for Android Kotlin Fundamentals Codelab 6.2 Coroutines

Introduction
------------

TrackMySleepQuality is an app for recording sleep data for each night. 
You can record a start and stop time, assign a quality rating, and clear the database. 

In this codelab, working from this starter app, you will:

* Extend the TrackMySleepQuality app to collect, store, and display data in and from the database. 
* Use coroutines to run long-running database operations in the background. 
* Use LiveData to trigger navigation and showing of a snackbar. 
* Use LiveData to enable and disable buttons.


Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to know:

* Building a basic user interface (UI) for an Android app, 
  using an activity, fragments, and views.
* Navigating between fragments and using Safe Args (a Gradle plugin) 
  to pass data between fragments.
* View models, view-model factories, and LiveData and its observers. 
  These Architecture Components topics are covered in an earlier codelab in this course.
* A basic understanding of SQL databases and the SQLite language.
* How to create a Room database, create a DAO, and define entities, 
  from the previous Room codelab[LINK]. 
* It is helpful if you are familiar with threading and multiprocessing concepts.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.
